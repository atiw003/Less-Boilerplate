Less Boilerplate
=============================

I decided to go through my recent projects and pull out the most commonly used styles. Here they are for your design enjoyment!

Written in [Less.CSS](http://lesscss.org/), the dynamic stylesheet language.

Check out the [demo](http://mgeraci.github.com/Less-Boilerplate/).

Contents:
---------
- CSS Reset
- CSS3 Helpers (box radius, gradients, box shadow, transition)
- Centered column blocks
- Horizontal centering for objects of variable width
- A fancy call to action button
- A few general styles and sensible defaults (including a clearfix)

Usage:
--------
Include this file in at the top of your LESS stylesheet:

    @import 'boilerplate';

Enjoy!
