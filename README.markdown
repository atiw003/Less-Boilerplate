Less Boilerplate
=============================

I decided to go through my recent projects and pull out the most commonly used styles. Here they are for your design enjoyment!

Written in [Less.CSS](http://lesscss.org/).

*Less is more.*

Contents:
---------
- CSS Reset
- CSS3 Helpers (box shadow, gradients, box radius)
- Centered column blocks
- Horizontal centering for objects of variable width
- A fancy call to action button
- A few general styles

Usage:
--------
Include this file in at the top of your LESS stylesheet:

    @import 'boilerplate'

Enjoy!
